Clang - Perl bindings to the Clang compiler's indexing interface

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use v5.10;

    use Clang;

    my $index = Clang::Index -> new(1);

    my $tunit = $index -> parse('file.c');
    my $nodes = $tunit -> cursor -> children;

    foreach my $node (@$nodes) {
        say $node -> spelling;
        say $node -> kind -> spelling;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++
programming languages which uses LLVM as its back end.

This module provides Perl bindings to the Clang indexing interface, used for
extracting high-level symbol information from source files without exposing
the full Clang C++ API.
